# FastAPI and Streamlit Application

This project features a FastAPI backend application integrated with Replicateâ€™s image generation and fine-tuning endpoints. It also includes a Streamlit frontend to enable user interaction, where users can upload images, create and fine-tune models, and generate images based on text prompts.

## Key Features:
1. **File Upload**: Supports image uploads for fine-tuning models.
2. **Model Creation**: Creates new models on Replicate via API.
3. **Fine-Tuning**: Fine-tunes models using training data provided by the user.
4. **Image Generation**: Generates images from a user-provided prompt.
